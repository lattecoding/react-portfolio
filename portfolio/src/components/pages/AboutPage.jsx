      <p>
        My name is Luis and I am a Web Developer. I'm from Connecitcut and
        currently enrolled in a bootcamp, learning the skills and tools needed
        to learn front end and back end developement.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I have complete the bootcamp I plan on making a few small personal
        websites to build up my portfolio and showcase my skills. Two I have
        planned is this landing page that showcases some of my projects and a
        personal blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking to start a new career as a full stack developer. If you or
        someone you know thinks I could be a good fit, fill out the contact form
        to reach me!
