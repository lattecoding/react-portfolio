      <p>
        My name is Luis and I am currently learning Web Development. Currently
        enrolled in a bootcamp that will teach me the skills and tools needed to
        learn front end and back end developement.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I have completed the bootcamp I plan on making a few small
        websites to build up my portfolio and showcase my skills. Two I have
        planned is a personally landing page for all my projects and a personal
        blog. Hopefully this all leads to a new career as a Full Stack
        Developer.
